## Talks
### The Role of the Architect
A talk on how the role of the Software Architect emerged, how technology shifts resulted in an increase in the choice of technologies in the toolbox and the need for the dedicated architect. What 'types' of architects there are and what skills are needed to do the job.

This was part of the first lecture I gave on an MSc course in [**Software Architecture & Design**](https://www.cit.ie/course/CRKSDEV9) at [CIT](https://www.cit.ie/) (Cork Institute of Technology, now known as [Munster Technological University](https://www.mtu.ie/)). The course was aimed at aspiring software architects, working in fulltime employment.

### Working in the Software Industry
This was a talk given to UCC undergraduates in February 2016, before they undertook their internships (in third year). It talks about the various roles in the industry and the skills needed by software engineers covering both technical and 'soft skills'. It goes on to cover industry trends, IoT (the focus of the company I was then working for), how and where we work. It finished with a Q&A and with questions for the audience to consider to help them determine the type of job the might like and the sort of company they would like to work for.
