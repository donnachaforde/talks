# Blogs



***
I'm collate articles I've written previously so this is work in progress. I put a little effort into formalizing the blog on JVM Performance Tuning so that is well-structured. I've only just started on Code Design as an attempt to capture some of the design and thought processes that go into writing code the way I do. That is something that has naturally developed over the years so it takes a little bit of effort to articulate that. 


Here's some content to get the ball rolling...

### Contents
