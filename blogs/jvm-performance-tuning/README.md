##### Background
These blogs came about after having to dig into JVM Tuning of the Hotspot VM on a development project I was working, several years ago now. We were still shipping to 32-bit OS and had reached the limits of addressable memory on that architecture. My job was to ensure we could squeeze in our memory requirements under the max threshold - and - improve performance. 

I ended up digging much deeper than originally expected. I pretty much read everything that had been published online by Sun and later, Oracle, on JVM Performance Tuning, several interesting articles and a few books. The blogs are my attempt to capture and explain the details before time moved on and I'd naturally start to forget. (JVM Performance Tuning is not my full-time job.)
