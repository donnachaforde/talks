# Blogs on Code Design
***
I'm trying to develop the habit of blogging about design choices as I work through coding, starting with a project I've recently resurrected. 

First, I've learnt that thinking can be improved just through the process of _putting pen to paper_. At one point in my career, while sustaining a complex system in the field, I adopted a process of summarising cases I'd just received and found the process to be invaluable at clearing out the crud and sticking to the facts. Now, I adopting much the same process when designing code solutions. Second, when working with languages like C++ and Java, but particularly with C++, there are often so many choices on how to achieve a solution that the mind can become a little boggled with design choices. The act of stating what you what to achieve, why you want to do it - and listening influences on your thought process really helps clarify choices and explains the 'design journey', which the final code solution can never in itself reveal.
